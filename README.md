This Python tool assesses password strength based on five criteria: length, uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits, and special characters. 
Here's how it works:
Length: Checks if the password is at least 8 characters long.

Uppercase: Ensures there is at least one uppercase letter (e.g., A, B, C).

Lowercase: Ensures there is at least one lowercase letter (e.g., a, b, c).

Digits: Looks for at least one number (e.g., 0, 1, 2).

Special Characters: Checks for special symbols (e.g., !, @, #).

The program then gives feedback on whether each criterion is met and rates the password strength as Weak, Moderate, or Strong based on the total number of criteria met.
